# Omni DNA Finetuning

This repository contains code and benchmarks for finetuning Omni DNA models.

## Files

- **train_omni_dna.ipynb** - Main training notebook for finetuning Omni DNA models
- **omni_dna_base_benchmark.ipynb** - Benchmark notebook for evaluating Omni DNA model performance
- **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebooks for training and benchmarking

## Project Structure

- Checkpoints are saved during training in the model-specific directories
- Base models can be evaluated using the benchmark notebook

## Notes

This project uses Omni DNA for promoter classification and sequence analysis tasks.
